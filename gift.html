            On the eve of holidays and significant events, each of us is faced with the need to find a decent, useful and original gift.
            We spend hours racking our brains and tormented by the problem of choice. Suddenly, you will not like the gift, it will seem banal or formal. One of the most convenient,
            modern and always appropriate ways to make a pleasant surprise is a gift certificate to the SPA salon "Ginger Thai Spa".
            This option is suitable both for a presentation to a business partner and for a gift to a loved one.</p>
        <p>A gift certificate for Thai massage "Ginger Thai Spa" is a beautiful personalized document that contains the name of the SPA program or the amount,
            which is paid as a gift. Thus, you can either choose the procedure for a friend yourself, or give him the opportunity to make his own choice.
            The minimum cost of the certificate is equivalent to 1 hour of any procedure (from 15,000 tenge). The maximum amount is unlimited and depends solely on your desire.
            If you want, with the help of a certificate, you can give a full-fledged subscription to the Ginger Thai Spa salon.
